Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an\\nendoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle\\ninto my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who\\nwas there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors\\nstarted crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is\\ncurable with surgery.
